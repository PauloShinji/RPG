<h1 id="hi-and-welcome">Hi, and welcome!</h1>
<p>Thank you for your interest in participating in this game-experiment!<br>

<h2 id="but-what-is-this-game">But what is this game?</h2>
<p>This is an RPG based mostly in Dungeons and Dragons üêâ üé≤, aiming to portray life in a conflict zone situation. Players here may choose a role, being a local, a foreigner, a member of the private sector, government, NGO, Army, Medic, Community Leader, Socialite etc. etc.</p>
<p>In short, you can be whatever you wish.</p>
<p>The game happens in a partially fictitious world üåç. It is largely based on our own, and I mostly call it fictitious to avoid having to be omniscient of the current world as I guide you through the game.</p>
<p>More specifically, the game takes place in the country of <strong>Landskein</strong>, a place that is 100% fictitious. You will receive information about the place according to your background. For now, it suffices to say that <strong>Landskein</strong> is a country in the Global South, in which many NGOs, Humanitarian Organisations and International Organisations are operating.</p>
<h2 id="and-how-do-you-play">And how do you play?</h2>

<p>I will let each player figure out how to play during the game itself. Partially this is to set the scene, and partially because I am still testing some mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, there is one important thing you should know:</p>
<p>RPG stands for <strong>ROLE</strong> Playing Game. This means players will have to impersonate a role. That is the main ‚Äì and only ‚Äì criteria to define a good RPG player.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-you-have-to-do-now">So, what do you have to do now?</h2>
